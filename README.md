# Agentic Rag

How often do you wish your AI could do more than just repeat what it already knows? As someone who’s spent countless hours refining and tweaking AI systems, I can tell you that traditional models, while impressive, often feel like they’re stuck in a bubble limited to what they’ve been trained on. Here’s where Agentic RAG comes into the picture.

In agentic RAG, the decision-making abilities of agentic AI meet the adaptability of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Together, they form a system that can independently access, reason with, and generate relevant information.

## Step 1: User query

Whether it’s a simple query or a complex problem, it all starts with a question from the user. This is the spark that sets our pipeline in motion.

## Step 2: Routing the query

Next, the system checks: Can I answer this?

Yes? It pulls from existing knowledge and delivers the response immediately.

No? Time to dig deeper! The query gets routed to the next step.

## Step 3: Retrieving the data

If the answer isn’t readily available, the pipeline dives into two possible sources:

Local documents: We’ll use a pre-processed PDF as our knowledge base, where the system searches for relevant chunks of information.
Internet search: If more context is needed, the pipeline can reach out to external sources to scrape up-to-date information.

## Step 4: Building the context

The retrieved data whether from the PDF or the web, is then compiled into a coherent, retrieved context. Think of it as gathering all the puzzle pieces before putting them together.

## Step 5: Final answer generation

Finally, this context is passed to a large language model (LLM) to craft a clear and accurate answer. It’s not just about retrieving data, it’s about understanding and presenting it in the best possible way.

By the end of this, we’ll have a smart, efficient RAG pipeline that can dynamically respond to queries with real-world context.
